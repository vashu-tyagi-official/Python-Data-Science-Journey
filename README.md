# üêç Python Learning Journey
Welcome to my personal repository dedicated to documenting my journey learning Python! This space serves as a comprehensive log of my progress, notes, code examples, and projects as I dive deeper into the world of Python programming.
# üöÄ About This Repository
**Track Progress**: Keep a clear record of topics covered and skills acquired.
**Store Code**: House all code examples, exercises, and mini-projects.
**Organize Notes**: Consolidate learning notes, concepts, and explanations.
**Showcase Projects**: Feature completed projects that demonstrate understanding and application of Python.
Whether you're a fellow learner or just curious, feel free to explore!
# üó∫Ô∏è Learning Path & Topics Covered
My learning journey will cover a wide range of Python concepts, starting from the fundamentals and moving towards specialized areas in data analysis, machine learning, and deep learning.
1. **Python Fundamentals Core Concepts**: Covering essential Python syntax, data types, control flow, functions, object-oriented programming (OOP) principles, module usage, file handling, error handling, and advanced concepts like decorators and generators.
2. **Data Manipulation & Analysis**
    * **NumPy**: Working with numerical data, arrays, and array operations.
    * **Pandas**: DataFrames and Series, data loading, cleaning, manipulation, and aggregation.
4. **Data Visualization**
    * **Matplotlib**: Creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python.
    * **Seaborn**: Statistical data visualization built on Matplotlib.
5. **Machine Learning**
   * **Scikit-learn**: Implementing a wide range of machine learning models (e.g., linear regression, classification, clustering, dimensionality reduction).
   * **Machine Learning Fundamentals**: Introduction to supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning concepts.
6. **Deep Learning**
   * **TensorFlow**: An open-source machine learning framework for building and training neural networks.
   * **Keras**: A high-level neural networks API, written in Python and capable of running on top of TensorFlow.
   * **PyTorch**: An open-source machine learning framework known for its flexibility and dynamic computation graph.
